		<h3 class="bleedBlue">1. Proposed Hypothesis</h3>
		<p>In this experiment, we will explore and try to answer the effect of training on Human mind capacity to perceive the rarely visible information. In the first part of the experiment, we will conduct experiment on the subjects to test how fast and accurate human mind is to perceive visual elements in a denser screen. Later, in the second part of the experiment, we will perform the same experiment on different subjects to test human mind capacity limits but with some initial training (In this report, we have used terms Training or Learning interchangeably). The comparison of the result between two groups (with or without training) of the experiment will be the key to the answer in this experiment.</p>
		<p>The training provided in second part of the experiment to the subjects is to show them the similar object for 5 seconds, they have to identify in the actual experiment. The experiments are designed to test the subject's ability to determine a specific object on screen with or without suitable training and the effect of training in experim</p>

		<p>Objects used in this experiment are two 8 x 8 grid (64 squares) as shown in Fig 1, whereas in first grid (Fig. 1a.) each square has one of the highly discriminable color and only one square has unique color within that grid. The colors used in the first grid are
			<span style="color:#C0C040;background-color:#C0C040;font-size:16px;margin-right:3px">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span>
			<span style="color:#C08040;background-color:#C08040;font-size:16px;margin-right:3px">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span>

			<span style="color:#3FBFBF;background-color:#3FBFBF;font-size:16px;margin-right:3px">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span>, whereas color 
			<span style="color:#3FBFBF;background-color:#3FBFBF;font-size:16px;margin-right:3px">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> has only one square in the grid. In the second grid (Fig 1b.) the colors used in the grid was less discriminable and similar to grid 1a this grid also has only one unique color square. The colors used in the second grid are

			<span style="color:#C2FF99;background-color:#C2FF99;font-size:16px;margin-right:3px">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> has only one square in the grid. The other objects used in this experiment are two 8 x 8 grid (64 squares) as shown in Fig 2, but here each grid of Fig 2 (i.e Fig 2a & Fig 2b) are flood fill grid with same color. The catch of the experiment is that the color used in Fig 2a is the unique color of Fig 1a and color used in Fig 2b is the unique color of Fig 1b. The subjects' task is to identify the unique colored square in grids of Fig 1. A subject will be presented both grids of Fig 1 either with or without training.</p><br/>
		<span>There are few areas where we can use this experiment:</span>
		<ul>
			<li>This experiment could prove to be very important in Military / Security forces training to identify the specified targets or enemies in deep forests or similar noisy places. Basically this experiment can be a huge benefit when combined with simulation models to train the army.</li>
			<li>We can also use this experiment in games, where user has to find the specified target and destroy it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There exists some relevant work where researchers Steve Haroz and David Whitney have tried to answer the response time and accuracy based on grouping of objects but haven't considered the effect of training subjects prior to experiment. In the experiment, Steve Haroz and David Whitney have tried to answer the importance of grouping objects. In thisexperimental we will try to answer the importance of human mind perceptiveness. Below we have explained in depth details of each step of the experiment.</p><br/>
		<h3 class="bleedBlue">2. Experimental Method</h3>
		<h4 class="bleedBlue">2.1 Overview</h4>
		<p>In This experiment, we will try to test the human mind capacity limits, whether how fast or accurate can it be to perceive or identify a particular object (a unique colored square in our experiment) in a 8 x 8 grid (64 colored square) in either of the two conditions, whether the subject have been shown the similar object (for 2 seconds) prior to experiment or not). The key idea of the experiment to test whether the training we provide to subjects is helping them to identify the pattern easily or not. We will perform the experiment Online (or using MTurk), which would be very similar to natural settings (Field Studies) and we won't be able to perform the experiment in lab environment. Though it will help us to identify how good the experiment be in natural conditions. We decided to perform experiment in between groups, one group don't have any prior experience or learning and second group has been provided some learning.</p>
		<p>We will run the experiment between 2 groups (Group A & group B), having a large number of subjects in each group. Each subject in "Group A" will be presented the grids shown in Fig. 1 one after another and will be asked to identify the square with unique color in each grid. Each subject in "Group B" will be presented the grids shown in Fig 2 & Fig 1 one after another respectively in the following sequence 2a (just for 2 seconds to train subjects mind or indicate to find the similar pattern or color in next grid), 1a, 2b (similar to 2a for training purpose), 1b. This will facilitate us to measure the effect of training / prior learning on how quickly trained subjects can perceive data hidden in the visualization than other subjects who don't have any prior knowledge.</p>
		<p>The independent variable in this experiment is the color intensity used in the grid. In first 8 x 8 grid colors used were highly discriminable and in the second 8 x 8 grid colors used were less discriminable, so subjects in each group has to take 2 runs in their experiment. The dependent variables in the experiment are the time taken by each subject to identify the unique color square in the grid and the accuracy of identifying the unique color.</p>
		<h4 class="bleedBlue">2.2 Data collection</h4>
		<p>Data collection is the very important phase of an experiment as it enables or facilitates the researcher to make a decision from the experiment. In other words data collected during experiment helps to prove the hypothesis. In this experiment we tried to collect as muchdata possible either from experiment or future work point of view. The data / variables collected in experiment were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The time taken by subject to identify the unique square in the grid of squares. This is considered to be the most important part in the experiment.</li>
			<li>The accuracy of a subject in identifying a unique color square in the grid of squares. The data collected, if inaccurate will be removed while inferencing the results.</li>
			<li>Subjects gender and Subjects age are other two factors that we are storing as a data of our experiment. The main reason to store subjects age is to identify the human mind capacity or whether the subject was mentally fit for the experiment (too old subjects may not have the same mind capacity as the middle or young age subjects).</li>
			<li>Though we will run our experiment online, It's important for us to identify the attentiveness of the subject doing our experiment. We will keep track of this by having some very simple questions to answer before, after or in the middle of the puzzle.</li>
			<li>Though at present we considered Noise & Room lighting as confound variables and as we will run our experiment online, we can't keep track of it in order to see whether they have any impact on the time taken by subject to complete the experiment.</li>
			<li>There are some other factor involved in data that we are considering to be present. We assumed that the subjects, who took part in the experiment had no color blindness and had no weak eyesight.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 class="bleedBlue">2.3 Selected Subjects</h4>
		<p>Having ideal subjects for the experiments are the most important or crucial part of the experiment as the experiment, it's data, it's accuracy, the prove of hypothesis and every factor about the experiment is directly attached with the data or results produced by the subjects. Sketching the attributes of the subjects for an experiments could be a tedious work. For our experiment we have tried and thought over every possible scenario and then identify the attributes of the subjects.</p>
		<p>The subjects selected for this experiment are men and women within the age group of 18 - 35 years. There are several other factors involved in selecting a subject. The subject should not have color blindness or weak eyesight, should be mentally fit . There is a reason of why we have selected these subjects as a representative samples. As the experiment is based on human mind capacity or attention to identify a particular object fast and accurately. We have tried to run our experiment on people of a specific age group between from 18 years to 35 years, we haven't included the subjects over 35 years because as with age, human mind capacity decrease rapidly and it would affect the results we gather from subjects.</p>
		<p>Subjects in our experiment will be in same proportion in each group (let's say we put 3 females and 2 males). The subjects could be of any background as we aren't imposing any restriction on the subjects background, his/her educational history etc. The reason for this is obvious as we have no crucial data to understand or involved in this experiment (unlike graphs, bars, box plots) it doesn't really matter from which background the subject is.</p>
		<h4 class="bleedBlue">2.4 Data analysis</h4>
		<p>Data Analysis if done correctly can provide the new insights of the data, sometimes more than what is expected as a result, Though Analysing the data collected during the experiment depends on how correct your data is. Data collected during the experiment need to be analysed very carefully. We perform data cleaning on data collected in Data collection phase, using multiple parameters, in order to get accurate data.</p>
		<p>The first step would be to remove the inaccurate data. By inaccurate data we mean the data in which subject couldn't identify the unique color square correctly, such data is of no use for our experiment. We will exclude that data. Secondly we will perform a normal distribution on the data based on the time took to identify object in screen and will take the data up to 2 standard deviation and will remove the data after 2 standard deviation. After these steps we assume that the data now we have is accurate.</p>
		<p>We will then analyse data based on the time taken by each group "Group A" and "Group B", where one group been shown the flood fill of grid of same color before the actual experiment. The data is plotted in the scatter plot, where x axis represent the variety of grids and y axis represent the response time. We're planning to include the scatter plots with respects to groups and their response time in future. The other factors involved in the experiment is to compare the result based on the subjects gender and age in between the groups.</p>
		<h4 class="bleedBlue">Practical setup & Future Work</h4>
		<p>The practical setup either can be used In person or using Mechanical Turk. There are several advantages or disadvantages of having each setup. In person practical setup we can control practical room conditions as lighting of the room or noise in the room. The details that we get about the subject will also be accurate, be in age of the subject, gender of the subject.</p>
		<p>For our experiment, we will use Online mechanism or Mechanical turk to run the experiment. The reason we selected the Online mechanism / Mechanical Turk is because we want to test our experiment on large user group. Though we know the data we get online is not always accurate, so we will remove the data that we don't want for our experiment result. For the online experiment, we will introduce a series of very simple questions just to test whether subject is paying attention to complete the experiment or not. We'll exclude all those results in which user will answer the simple questions wrong.</p>
		<p>There is also some future work involved in this experiment, we have designed a web page for the experiment in order to get the experiment done. After design, we are carrying this experiment to get the subjects response from real world so that we will have actual data for the experiment. We will perform all the steps described in this paper for experiment from data cleaning to data analysis and then hypothesis testing.</p><br>
