		<h3 class="bleedBlue">1. Proposed Hypothesis</h3>
		<p>In this experiment, we will explore and try to answer the effect of training on Human mind capacity to perceive the rarely visible information. In the first part of the experiment, we will conduct experiment on the subjects to test how fast and accurate human mind is to perceive visual elements in a denser screen. Later, in the second part of the experiment, we will perform the same experiment on different subjects to test human mind capacity limits but with some initial training (In this report, we have used terms Training or Learning interchangeably). The comparison of the result between two groups (with or without training) of the experiment will be the key to the answer in this experiment.</p>
		<p>The training provided in second part of the experiment to the subjects is to show them the similar object for 5 seconds, they have to identify in the actual experiment. The experiments are designed to test the subjectâ€™s ability to determine a specific object on screen with or without suitable training and the effect of training in experim</p>
