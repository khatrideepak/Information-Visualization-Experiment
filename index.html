		<h3 class="bleedBlue">1. Proposed Hypothesis</h3>
		<p>In this experiment, we will explore and try to answer the effect of training on Human mind capacity to perceive the rarely visible information. In the first part of the experiment, we will conduct experiment on the subjects to test how fast and accurate human mind is to perceive visual elements in a denser screen. Later, in the second part of the experiment, we will perform the same experiment on different subjects to test human mind capacity limits but with some initial training (In this report, we have used terms Training or Learning interchangeably). The comparison of the result between two groups (with or without training) of the experiment will be the key to the answer in this experiment.</p>
		<p>The training provided in second part of the experiment to the subjects is to show them the similar object for 5 seconds, they have to identify in the actual experiment. The experiments are designed to test the subject's ability to determine a specific object on screen with or without suitable training and the effect of training in experim</p>

		<span>Fig 2. Both Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b  are flood fill with same color as a unique color in Fig 1 grids, we use these images in only one group as a hint to identify unique square easily.</span><br/><br/><br/>
		<p>Objects used in this experiment are two 8 x 8 grid (64 squares) as shown in Fig 1, whereas in first grid (Fig. 1a.) each square has one of the highly discriminable color and only one square has unique color within that grid. The colors used in the first grid are "#C0C040, #C08040, #B1B1B1, #4040C0, #40C040, #BF3FBF, #3FBFBF", whereas color "#3FBFBF" has only one square in the grid. In the second grid (Fig 1b.) the colors used in the grid was less discriminable and similar to grid 1a this grid also has only one unique color square. The colors used in the second grid are "#1CE6FF, #FDE8DC, #FFA0F2, #FFF69F, #63FFAC, #B5F4FF, #C895C5, #C2FF99", whereas color "#C2FF99" has only one square in the grid. The other objects used in this experiment are two 8 x 8 grid (64 squares) as shown in Fig 2, but here each grid of Fig 2 (i.e Fig 2a & Fig 2b) are flood fill grid with same color. The catch of the experiment is that the color used in Fig 2a is the unique color of Fig 1a and color used in Fig 2b is the unique color of Fig 1b. The subjects' task is to identify the unique colored square in grids of Fig 1. A subject will be presented both grids of Fig 1 either with or without training.</p><br/>
		<span>There are few areas where we can use this experiment:</span>
		<ul>
			<li>This experiment could prove to be very important in Military / Security forces training to identify the specified targets or enemies in deep forests or similar noisy places. Basically this experiment can be a huge benefit when combined with simulation models to train the army.</li>
			<li>We can also use this experiment in games, where user has to find the specified target and destroy it.</li>
